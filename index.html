    Hello everyone, my name is Aditya. My favorite hobby is basketball. I started playing basketball games when I move to Fishers, Indiana. When I moved here, my friends taught me these games that you can play with a basketball. These games were really fun so I startrd playing this with my friends like everyday if my work is done. So the games that I learnt were called 4 square, knock out, revenge, and poison. The game we play the most now is 4 square. Knock out, poison, revenge are games that you have to shoot the basketball. But, 4 square, you don't have to shoot the ball. 4 square is an infinte game. That is why we all like it so much. So, in the game you have to pass the ball with 1 hand if the ball is in your square. If the ball bounces 2 times in your square, you're out and go back to he line. That is how 4 square works. How to play poison is that you have to shoot the ball in the hoop and the ball should at least touch the rim so you won't be out. If the the ball doesn't touch the rim 3 times, you are out. How to play reveange is that there is 2 players, they have to try to make the goal and they pass it to the next person. If the person in the game doesn't make it in 2 times, they are out. You could come back in when another person gets the person that you got out by, then you are in. Knock out is the same thing as revenge but you can't get back in.
